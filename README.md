Modifying Daniel Shiffman's Smart Rockets

Daniel Shiffman is an awesome youtuber who has a channel called "The Coding Train"  ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw ) where he provides wonderful javascript tutorials using the p5 library ( https://p5.js ).

From Daniel I have learned a lot about the p5 library and basic Javascript programming, but in my day job I work with another fantastic developer, Scott Burch, who has shown me how to apply functional programmign to Javascript. 

What I want to do here is take what Daniel has done and see if I can apply what Scott has taught me. I would like to take Daniel's code, which is easy for a new developer to understand and turn it into code that is production ready.I want to uses a functional style to reduce the size of the code and speed things up a little and make things a bit more readable.

My first project will start with Coding Challenge #29: Smart Rockets in p5.js ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGz7mv2vD6g ). Use Brackets ( http://brackets.io ) to open the SmartRockets folder and run the app.
